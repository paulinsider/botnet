 * \brief interface to radix_trie implementation for fast address lookup
 *
 ** This implementation is designed to quickly search over addresses
 *  (currently IPv4 only) and determine if an address matches one or
 *  more subnets that have been inserted into the trie.  Each subnet is
 *  associated with a label, and there can be up to MAX_NUM_FLAGS
 *  labels (as they are interally represented as bit flags).
